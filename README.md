# COVID-19 Country-Wise Data Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using Python in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
It explores how the pandemic affected different countries by comparing confirmed, recovered, death, and active cases.
The goal is to uncover key trends, correlations, and insights from the dataset.

Objectives

Identify countries most affected by COVID-19.

Compare recovery and death rates across countries.

Explore the relationship between confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Visualize regional differences using WHO regions.

Research Questions

Which countries have the highest number of confirmed cases?

Which countries recorded the highest death rates?

Which countries have the best recovery rates?

How are active cases distributed globally?

Which WHO regions reported the most confirmed cases?

What is the correlation between confirmed, recovered, and death cases?

Analysis and Visualizations

Top 10 countries by confirmed cases → Bar Chart

Top 10 by death rate (%) → Bar Chart

Top 10 by recovery rate (%) → Bar Chart

Distribution of active cases → Histogram

Confirmed cases by WHO Region → Bar Chart

Correlation Heatmap → Seaborn Heatmap

Key Insights

1️⃣ The USA, India, and Brazil had the highest confirmed cases.
2️⃣ Death rates were higher in regions with weaker health infrastructure.
3️⃣ Countries with effective responses showed higher recovery rates.
4️⃣ WHO Regions like the Americas and Europe were most affected.
5️⃣ Confirmed and recovered cases show a strong positive correlation.

Conclusion

This analysis highlights the uneven global impact of COVID-19 and shows how data visualization can simplify complex health data.
The project demonstrates practical use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for real-world data analysis and storytelling.
